This example shows how to configure wrogts to
make mirrors for kernel.org, gnu.org and gnome.org

Essentially this means:
1. You need to reade separate dir
2. Place wrogts_mirrorer.conf.yaml in dir created at step 1
3. edit new wrogts_mirrorer.conf.yaml so there would be
    structure like so (YAML):
- options: {}
  targets:
    kernel.org: null
    gnu.org: null
    gnome.org
4. Start wrogts with command like this:
    `wrogts run-mirroring PATH_TO_DIR_WITH_CONFIG`
