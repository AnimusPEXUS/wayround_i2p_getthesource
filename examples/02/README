This is example for running wrogts in simple mode

Wrogts simple mode is simmple command line mode without need for any
configuration files: everything which might bee needed to be
configured is present in options

So here is example command line for making mirror of
http://www.linux-pam.org/library/

wrogts simple 'http://www.linux-pam.org/library/' OUTPUT_DIR

where OUTPUT_DIR is path to dir in which you wish to see work done.

OUTPUT_DIR's structure will be following:

simple-cache/
simple-logs/
downloads/{basename}/{tarballs}

where {basename} is name of one of tarballs been found on http/html
site directory, and {tarballs} are downloaded tarballs
